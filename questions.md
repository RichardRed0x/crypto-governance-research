This document sets out a high level structure for an overview of a blockchain project's governance. 

## Where does the governance happen?

Recording the places where governance activity is happening is one of the more important aspects of this resource. Where a blockchain aims to have decentralized governance with permissionless access, everyone who is interested should where they can observe and participate in this governance. 

## Consensus

- Does the project have its own blockchain or is it a token on another chain? (many questions are not relevant for tokens)

- What is the mechanism for ensuring consensus about the state of the blockchain?

  Consensus mechanism label:

  - PoW
  - PoS
  - PoW/PoS Hybrid
  - DPoS
  - Byzantine Fault Tolerant
  - Master Nodes
  
- Which entities interact with the blockchain? What role does each entity play? How are the "block producers" selected?

- If there is a Proof of Stake component, does it involve delegation?

- How are changes to the consensus rules implemented?

- Has the project been re-branded or re-named at any point?

## Coin/Token Distribution

* *How were/are coins distributed? Was there an ICO? Is there inflation now? Is there a fixed supply?*

# Funding

- What is the reference node implementation?
- Any other full node implementations?

### How is development funded?

- Donations
- ICO
- Block reward
- Foundation/company
- Grants
- Not public/known

##### How much or what proportion from each type of source?

How are funds managed?

- Non-profit foundation
- For-profit company
- Community voting/DAO mechanism

What is the scope of funded work?

How are decisions about use of funds made?
